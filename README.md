## Honest Roles

**Take Control of Your Career**  
An LLM-powered job board built by technical talent for technical talent.

---

### The Problem

Technical job discovery is highly inefficient.

Traditional job boards create noise, missed opportunities, and poor matches:

- Roles can be outdated, duplicated, or no longer active (False positives)  
- Left out location and eligibility constraints can make many listings infeasible (False positives)
- Relevant roles are missed due to narrow title searches (False negatives)  

At the same time, a negative feedback loop is emerging:

- Job postings are increasingly AI-generated and keyword optimized  
- Candidates tailor resumes to match keywords instead of real skills  
- Automated tools mass-submit templated applications  
- Recruiters receive overwhelming low-signal submissions  

**Result:** AI-generated postings → AI-optimized resumes → AI-filtered pipelines → declining signal for everyone.

---

### The Solution

**Honest Roles** restores signal to job discovery.

- Sources roles directly from applicant tracking systems (ATS) for freshness and authenticity  
- Uses LLM inference to:
  - Filters stale, duplicate, and infeasible listings  
  - match candidates by skills and capabilities, not just job titles
  - Surfaces relevant opportunities candidates would otherwise miss  
  - Apply objective ranking to highlight high-signal roles  
- Open-sources the ranking methodology for transparency  

---

### Mission

Reduce noise. Increase signal. Break the AI noise loop.  
Help technical talent discover opportunities that truly match their skills and goals.
